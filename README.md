# README: Impact of Legacy on Creating an End User-Focused Metadata Model based on Microsoft's Common Data Model

## Introduction
This readme provides an overview of the impact of legacy systems on the creation of a metadata model focused on end users. The metadata model is based on Microsoft's Common Data Model (CDM). It discusses the challenges and considerations involved in leveraging legacy systems to design an end user-friendly metadata model and highlights the benefits and best practices in this context.

## Legacy Systems and their Impact
Legacy systems refer to older, often outdated technology or software that is still in use within an organization. These systems may have been developed using older methodologies, data structures, and business rules. When creating a metadata model focused on end users, the presence of legacy systems can pose several challenges, such as:

1. **Data Complexity**: Legacy systems often contain complex data structures, inconsistent naming conventions, and outdated data models. Understanding and mapping these structures to a standardized metadata model can be time-consuming and require substantial effort.

2. **Data Quality**: Legacy systems may have data quality issues, including missing or inaccurate data. These issues need to be addressed during the metadata modeling process to ensure the end user receives reliable and accurate information.

3. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating legacy systems with modern technologies and the Common Data Model can be challenging due to differences in data formats, protocols, and APIs. Legacy systems may require additional connectors or customizations to seamlessly interact with the metadata model.

4. **Change Management**: Transitioning from legacy systems to a new metadata model requires careful change management. User training, documentation updates, and migration strategies are essential to ensure a smooth transition and user adoption.

## End User-Focused Metadata Model
An end user-focused metadata model aims to provide intuitive and user-friendly data representation. It considers the needs and preferences of end users, enabling them to easily understand, navigate, and interact with the data. When designing such a model, the following aspects should be considered:

1. **Simplicity**: The metadata model should have a simple and intuitive structure, with clear and meaningful naming conventions. It should reflect the terminology and domain knowledge of the end users, making it easier for them to comprehend and work with the data.

2. **Contextual Information**: Providing contextual information about the data elements, such as descriptions, synonyms, and examples, enhances end user understanding and facilitates self-service data exploration.

3. **Visualization and Reporting**: Incorporating visual elements, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, can improve data comprehension and enable end users to analyze and report on the data effectively.

4. **Self-Service Capabilities**: The metadata model should empower end users to access and utilize the data independently, reducing dependency on IT teams for routine data requests and enabling self-service analytics.

## Leveraging Microsoft's Common Data Model
Microsoft's Common Data Model (CDM) offers a standardized and extensible set of data schemas, entities, and attributes. It provides a solid foundation for building a metadata model that can be integrated with various Microsoft technologies and services. When leveraging CDM to create an end user-focused metadata model, consider the following:

1. **CDM Entities**: Map the entities in your legacy systems to the relevant CDM entities, ensuring consistency and compatibility. Define custom entities as needed to capture specific domain requirements.

2. **CDM Attributes**: Map the attributes of your legacy systems to the appropriate CDM attributes. Ensure that the mapping aligns with the naming conventions and data types specified in the CDM.

3. **Relationships and Associations**: Establish relationships and associations between entities within the metadata model to represent the data connections and dependencies. Leverage the CDM's built-in relationship types to define these associations accurately.

4. **Extensions and Customizations**: The CDM allows for extensions and customizations to accommodate unique business requirements. Extend the CDM schema when necessary to include additional attributes or entities that are specific to your organization's needs.

5. **Data Integration and Transformation**: Utilize the CDM's data integration capabilities, such as data connectors and transformation tools, to integrate data from legacy systems into the metadata model. Perform any necessary data cleansing, standardization, or transformation to ensure data quality and consistency.

6. **Metadata Documentation**: Document the metadata model comprehensively, including the mapping of legacy system attributes to CDM attributes, relationships between entities, and any customizations made. This documentation will aid in understanding and maintaining the metadata model in the future.

## Best Practices
To effectively create an end user-focused metadata model based on Microsoft's Common Data Model while incorporating legacy systems, consider the following best practices:

1. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve end users, data owners, and IT teams throughout the metadata modeling process. Gather their input, requirements, and feedback to ensure the model aligns with their needs and expectations.

2. **Iterative Approach**: Adopt an iterative approach to metadata modeling, starting with a subset of entities and gradually expanding the model. This allows for continuous refinement based on user feedback and evolving business requirements.

3. **Data Governance**: Implement data governance practices to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and compliance. Establish data stewardship roles and processes to manage and maintain the metadata model effectively.

4. **Training and Support**: Provide comprehensive training and support to end users on navigating and utilizing the metadata model. Offer resources, such as user guides, tutorials, and help desk support, to facilitate their adoption and proficiency.

5. **Collaboration and Communication**: Foster collaboration and communication between IT teams, data analysts, and end users to foster a shared understanding of the metadata model. Regularly communicate updates, enhancements, and changes to ensure transparency and user buy-in.

## Conclusion
Creating an end user-focused metadata model based on Microsoft's Common Data Model while incorporating legacy systems can be a complex undertaking. However, by addressing the challenges posed by legacy systems and following best practices, organizations can design a metadata model that empowers end users to easily access, understand, and leverage data for decision-making and analysis. The use of the CDM provides a standardized foundation, enabling seamless integration with Microsoft technologies and services.
